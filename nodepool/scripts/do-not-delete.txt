==========

The nodepool/scripts directory is empty and we no longer keep anything
in here.

This used to be used in the days of "snapshot images"; when we would
boot an upstream image from cloud providers, run a series of scripts
on it and then snapshot that image for use during CI.  This directory
would have customisation scripts to run.

Now we build daily images with dib and upload them and this is unused.

However, the directory remains important as a range of puppet things
try to deploy it as configuration.  Once all the puppet parts of
puppet-<openstackci|nodepool|project-config> have been removed, we can
remove this directory.
